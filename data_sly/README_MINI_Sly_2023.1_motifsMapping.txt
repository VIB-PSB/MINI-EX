###MINI_Sly_2023.1_motifMappings
#gff3: ITAG 4.0 (obtained from SolGenomics on August 2021). Filtered for protein coding genes.
#genome version: SL 4.0  (obtained from SolGenomics on August 2021).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 4000 Cluster Buster matches, top 7000 FIMO matches. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2020 (Fornes et al., 2020, PMID:31701148), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497).
#GO annotation(MINI-EX): downloaded on November 2021 from PLAZA Dicots 5.0. Biological Process (BP). GO evidence code: IBA, IDA, IEA, IEP, IGI, IMP, IPI, ISO, ISS, TAS. GO terms associated with > 1000 genes were filtered out.
