###MINI_Zma_2021.1_motifMappings
#gff3: AGP v4.0 (obtained from Plaza Monocots 4.5). Filtered for protein coding genes and longest splicing variant.
#genome version: AGP v4.0  (obtained from Plaza Monocots 4.5).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 8000 Cluster Buster matches, top 16000 FIMO matches. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2020 (Fornes et al., 2020, PMID:31701148), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497).
#GO annotation(MINI-EX): downloaded on November 2021 from PLAZA Monocots 4.5. Biological Process (BP). GO evidence code: EXP, IMP, IDA, IPI, IGI, IEP, TAS, NAS, IC.
