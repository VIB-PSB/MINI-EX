###MINI_Zma_NAM_v5.0_2023.1_motifMappings
#gff3: NAM-v5.0 (obtained from Plaza Monocots 5.0). Filtered for protein coding genes and longest splicing variant.
#genome version: NAM-v5.0  (obtained from Plaza Monocots 5.0).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 8000 Cluster Buster matches, top 16000 FIMO matches. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2022 (Castro-Mondragon, Riudavets-Puig and Rauluseviciute et al., 2020, PMID: 34850907), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497).
#GO annotation(MINI-EX): downloaded on September 2023 from PLAZA Monocots 5.0. Biological Process (BP). All GO evidence codes. Parental terms propagated, GO terms associated with > 12k genes filtered out after propagation.
