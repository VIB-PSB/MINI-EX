###MINI_Osa_2021.1_motifMappings
#gff3: JGI v7.0 (obtained from Plaza Dicots 4.5). Filtered for protein coding genes and longest splicing variant.
#genome version: JGI v7.0 (obtained from Plaza Dicots 4.5).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 6000 Cluster Buster matches, top 10000 FIMO matches.
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2020 (Fornes et al., 2020, PMID:31701148), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497).
#GO annotation(MINI-EX): downloaded on October 2023 from PLAZA Monocots 4.5. Biological Process (BP) + all GO evidence codes. Obsolete ids discarded and replaced with new ids (when provided); alternate ids replaced with corresponding primary ids; parental terms propagated; duplicate annotations discarded.
